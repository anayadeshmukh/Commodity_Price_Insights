## Commodity Price Intelligence: Analyzing Retail Price Volatility Across Regions (2019–2020) ##

**Business Objective:**

The primary objective of this project is to analyze retail pricing trends and the availability of essential commodities across Indian regions for the years 2019 and 2020. This includes:

* Identifying the most expensive commodities over two years and analyzing overlaps.
* Measuring price disparities across regions to detect maximum regional price differences.
* Understanding commodity diversity by analyzing how many varieties each commodity has.
* Investigating regional data density to highlight underrepresented states and their key commodities.
* Measuring price variation trends across cities over time to identify highly volatile commodities.

These insights can help policymakers, supply chain analysts, and local businesses:

* Make data-driven decisions on subsidy targeting.
* Identify regions facing unequal access or inflated pricing.
* Optimize distribution strategies.
* Predict future price instability.
